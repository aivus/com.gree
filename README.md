## Notes
### X-Fan
"X-Fan" mode might be turned off automatically by AC in case of switching HVAC mode from Dry and Cool.

That means you need to turn it on manually when switch to Dry/Cool mode if you want to use it.

### Vertical swing
"Disabled"/"Default" position means that vertical swing will be stopped and left on the current position.
